1. Press win+r and type devmgmt.msc to run the device manager.
2. Then you need to press F6 to focus on the device tree.
3. Find your touchpad device using donw arrow and right arrow etc., in my case it's 'I2C HID Device'.
4. Press shift+F10 to block the device and then restart it, this will revive your touchpad in most cases.
